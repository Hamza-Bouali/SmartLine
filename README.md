# **SmartLine**

SmartLine is an AI-powered automation platform designed to replace traditional human call center agents with intelligent AI agents. These agents can handle a wide range of business tasks, including customer support, lead generation, order confirmation, and more. Built with **Django** (backend), **React.js** (frontend), and **MySQL** (database), SmartLine is a scalable and efficient solution for businesses looking to automate their operations.

## **Inbound and Outbound Call System**

SmartLine provides two main functionalities for call automation:
1. **Inbound Calls**: 

The Inbound Call System is designed to handle incoming customer support calls efficiently. It uses Twilio's WebSocket API for real-time audio streaming and OpenAI's GPT model to generate intelligent, context-aware responses.

2. **Outbound Calls**:

The Outbound Call System automates proactive customer engagement for tasks like lead generation, order status updates, and order confirmations. It ensures businesses can reach out to customers efficiently and effectively.

Both systems are built using **FastAPI**, **Twilio**, and **OpenAI** for real-time voice interactions.

### **Inbound Call System**

The **Inbound Call System** is designed to handle incoming customer support calls. It uses Twilio's WebSocket API to stream audio in real-time and OpenAI's GPT model to generate responses.

#### **Key Features**:
- Real-time audio streaming using Twilio WebSocket.
- Integration with OpenAI for natural language processing.
- Automated responses for customer queries.
- Transcript logging for each call.

#### **How It Works**:
1. When a call is received, Twilio sends a request to the `/stream/incoming-call` endpoint.
2. The system establishes a WebSocket connection with Twilio and OpenAI.
3. Audio is streamed in real-time, and OpenAI generates responses based on the conversation.
4. The call transcript is logged for future reference.

### **Outbound Call System**

The **Outbound Call System** is used for making automated calls for:
- Lead generation.
- Order status updates.
- Order confirmations.

#### **Key Features**:
- Automated outbound calls using Twilio.
- Real-time interaction with customers using OpenAI.
- Customizable initial messages for different use cases.
- Transcript logging for each call.

#### **How It Works**:
1. The system initiates an outbound call using Twilio's API.
2. A WebSocket connection is established with Twilio and OpenAI.
3. The AI introduces itself and interacts with the customer based on predefined prompts.
4. The call transcript is logged for future reference.

## **Installation**

### Backend (Django)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/redaelkate/smartline.git
   cd smartline/backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the MySQL database:
   - Create a database in MySQL.
   - Update the `settings.py` file with your database credentials:
     ```python
     DATABASES = {
         'default': {
             'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
             'NAME': 'your_database_name',
             'USER': 'your_database_user',
             'PASSWORD': 'your_database_password',
             'HOST': 'localhost',
             'PORT': '3306',
         }
     }
     ```

5. Run migrations:

## **AI Agent Workflow**

SmartLine's AI agents are designed to handle the following tasks:
1. **Customer Support**: Answer FAQs, resolve issues, and escalate complex queries.
2. **Sales**: Recommend products, process orders, and upsell/cross-sell.
3. **Appointment Scheduling**: Book, reschedule, and cancel appointments.
4. **Data Collection**: Gather customer feedback and insights for analytics.

### **Outbound Call Automation Workflow**

The system uses **Twilio** for call automation and **FastAPI** for real-time audio streaming and AI integration. Here‚Äôs how the workflow operates:

1. **Initiate Outbound Call**:
   - The system initiates an outbound call using the **Twilio Service**.
   - The **Twilio Agent** handles the call setup and connection.

2. **Play Audio to Customer**:
   - Once the call is connected, the system plays pre-recorded or dynamically generated audio to the customer.

3. **Customer Responds**:
   - The customer‚Äôs response is captured and streamed to the **FastAPI Application**.

4. **Stream Audio to AI Model**:
   - The **FastAPI Agent** streams the customer‚Äôs audio to the **AI Model Service** for processing.

5. **Generate Response**:
   - The **AI Model Agent** analyzes the audio and generates an appropriate response.
   - The response is sent back to the **FastAPI Agent**.

6. **Stream Response to Twilio**:
   - The generated response is streamed back to the customer via the **Twilio Service**.

7. **Handle Hangup**:
   - The **Hangup Check Agent** continuously monitors the call for a hangup signal.
   - If a hangup is detected, the **Handle Hangup Agent** terminates the call and triggers post-call processing.

8. **Post-Call Processing**:
   - The **Data Collection Agent** collects call data and updates the **Excel Sheet** for reporting and analytics.
