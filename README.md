             'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
             'NAME': 'your_database_name',
             'USER': 'your_database_user',
             'PASSWORD': 'your_database_password',
             'HOST': 'localhost',
             'PORT': '3306',
         }
     }
     ```

5. Run migrations:
   ```bash

## Deployment

### Frontend (Vercel)
The frontend is deployed on Vercel. To deploy your own version:
1. Install the Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```
2. Deploy the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   vercel
   ```

### Backend (Render/Heroku/AWS)
The backend can be deployed on platforms like Render, Heroku, or AWS. For example, to deploy on Render:
1. Create a new Web Service on Render.
2. Connect your GitHub repository.
3. Set environment variables for your database and Django settings.
4. Deploy!

### **Documenting the UI**

Since you‚Äôre using AI agents, the UI likely includes dashboards, chat interfaces, and analytics panels. Here‚Äôs how you can document it:

#### **1. Key Pages**
- **Dashboard**: Overview of AI agent performance, task completion rates, and customer satisfaction.
- **Chat Interface**: Where customers interact with AI agents.
- **Analytics**: Detailed reports on agent performance, customer feedback, and task metrics.
- **Settings**: Customize AI agent behavior, workflows, and integrations.

#### **2. Tools for UI Documentation**
- Use **Storybook** to document React components.
- Use **Swagger** or **ReDoc** for API documentation.
- Use **MkDocs** or **Docusaurus** to combine all documentation into a single site.

---

### **Next Steps**
1. Let me know if you‚Äôd like to add more details about the AI agents or specific workflows.
2. Share screenshots or descriptions of the UI, and I can help you create detailed documentation.
3. If you need help setting up **Storybook** or **Swagger**, let me know!

This project sounds amazing, and I‚Äôm excited to help you make it even better! üöÄ
