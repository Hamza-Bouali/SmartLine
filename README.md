# **SmartLine**

SmartLine is an AI-powered automation platform designed to replace traditional human call center agents with intelligent AI agents. These agents can handle a wide range of business tasks, including customer support, lead generation, order confirmation, and more. Built with **Django** (backend), **React.js** (frontend), and **MySQL** (database), SmartLine is a scalable and efficient solution for businesses looking to automate their operations.

     DATABASES = {
         'default': {
             'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
             'NAME': 'your_database_name',
             'USER': 'your_database_user',
             'PASSWORD': 'your_database_password',
             'HOST': 'localhost',
             'PORT': '3306',
         }
     }
     ```

5. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Start the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Frontend (React.js)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## AI Agent Workflow

SmartLine's AI agents are designed to handle the following tasks:
1. **Customer Support**: Answer FAQs, resolve issues, and escalate complex queries.
2. **Sales**: Recommend products, process orders, and upsell/cross-sell.
3. **Appointment Scheduling**: Book, reschedule, and cancel appointments.
4. **Data Collection**: Gather customer feedback and insights for analytics.

### **Outbound Call Automation Workflow**

The system uses **Twilio** for call automation and **FastAPI** for real-time audio streaming and AI integration. Here‚Äôs how the workflow operates:

1. **Initiate Outbound Call**:
   - The system initiates an outbound call using the **Twilio Service**.
   - The **Twilio Agent** handles the call setup and connection.

2. **Play Audio to Customer**:
   - Once the call is connected, the system plays pre-recorded or dynamically generated audio to the customer.

3. **Customer Responds**:
   - The customer‚Äôs response is captured and streamed to the **FastAPI Application**.

4. **Stream Audio to AI Model**:
   - The **FastAPI Agent** streams the customer‚Äôs audio to the **AI Model Service** for processing.

5. **Generate Response**:
   - The **AI Model Agent** analyzes the audio and generates an appropriate response.
   - The response is sent back to the **FastAPI Agent**.

6. **Stream Response to Twilio**:
   - The generated response is streamed back to the customer via the **Twilio Service**.

7. **Handle Hangup**:
   - The **Hangup Check Agent** continuously monitors the call for a hangup signal.
   - If a hangup is detected, the **Handle Hangup Agent** terminates the call and triggers post-call processing.

8. **Post-Call Processing**:
   - The **Data Collection Agent** collects call data and updates the **Excel Sheet** for reporting and analytics.
